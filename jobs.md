# The Job Hunt

I think we can all agree that job hunting suuuuuuuuuuuuucks. Hard. It can feel like rejection after rejection or yelling into an unanswering void. And it's definitely hard to stay positive and active during this process! THEN once you get an interview with a company, they come at you with the technical portion which can be anything from a simple algorithm problem to solve, to a test designed for a senior software engineer, to a full stack app they expect you to build in a week... woof. 

And while I can't promise you a job by a certain date, what I CAN promise is that if you don't give up, you WILL get a job in tech, and it will be worth it. In the meantime, I'm here to commiserate with you and help in any way I can! Right off the bat, here are some of my favorite sites for looking for jobs (this is by NO means a comprehensive list): 

[WellFound](https://wellfound.com/jobs) - where I got my first programming job! This site is definitely geared more towards startups which can mean a few things: 
 
 1) They're looking for more senior-level talent
 2) They're is less time/opportunity for mentorship with a lean startup team
 3) Money might not be as great (my first SWE job paid me $60k)

Some pros though: 
 1) Sure they might WANT a senior engineer, but they can't afford one - so they hire a junior engineer who's a fast learner! 
 2) speaking of learning - you'll learn a LOT, really quickly. 

[Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/) - where I found my second job! GOOD NEWS everyone, while it's a pain in the ass to find your FIRST job in software, each job after that gets easier. I love their quick apply feature, which is part of what I attribute to me getting a job (just blasting out tons of resumes lol)

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) - LinkedIn is one of the premier ways to find a job, and a lot of people I know have had great success on this platform. As we all know, it's also a great networking site and a place for you to join other developer communities and grow your professional network. 

[BuiltIn](https://builtin.com/) - Built In has a lot of great features, and there are even offshoots of this site, like BuiltIn Chicago, BuiltIn San Francisco, etc. I love this site because each job posting is very clear about what technology they use, company history, the main duties of the role, and what perks/benefits the company offers! They also have a really nice filter/sort section that allows you to search for very specific jobs. 

[Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/jobs) - Do you need to be a woman to apply to jobs on this site? Nope!

[Purpose Jobs](https://app.purpose.jobs/talent/browse) - Their pitch is that they "connect top talent with purpose-driven companies based on values, experience and culture contribution." Sounds pretty neat!

[Otta](https://otta.com/) - Like the "dating app" of job search websites. Fill in information about what you know and like, and get matched up with companies that are looking for developers like you!

[No CS Degree](https://www.nocsdegree.com/jobs/) - Tech jobs that don't have a degree requirement CS.

[Bootup](https://candidate.joinbootup.com/jobs/) - They have a lot of engineering internships / junior roles!

Some key search terms for *software* jobs:
'software engineer', 'software developer', 'junior software engineer', 'jr. software developer', 'developer', 'jr. developer', 'web developer', 'jr. web developer'

Other awesome search terms: "Technical Support Engineer", "QA Engineer", "Support Engineer", "Site Reliability Engineer", "Sales Engineer", "Test Automation Engineer"

### Advice I've followed in the past that's paid off (and hopefully still will!): 

- Tailor your resume to the job posting! Do they use specific key works/skill descriptions in their job posting? Find a way to work some/as many as you can into your resume or cover letter! 

- Reach out to individuals who currently work at said company - DON'T ask for a job, ask about what it's like working for that company, what their day-to-day looks like, how they continue to grow in their role, etc. This way, you're building a relationship with someone at the company rather than asking them to go out of their way to help you, a stranger. If it's a good conversation, 8 times out of 10, they'll ask if you're interested in a role at their company or offer to pass your resume along to the hiring manager! THIS ONE IS HUGE - we have an overwhelming amount of anecdotal evidence that proves this is a great way to connect with the developer community AND land a job (indirectly) 

Ask questions! Remember, to a certain degree, you're interviewing them as much as they're interviewing you! It's so beneficial in your first tech role to have good guidance and mentorship, and so it never hurts to ask about that. When you get an interview with a company, it's a great idea to have questions prepared in the event that you're asked "do you have any questions for us?" Here are some questions that I've asked that have served me well: 

"As a junior engineer, I'm working hard to continue learning as much as I can! What resources do you use to keep learning and growing as a software engineer? And what resources did you rely on when you were just starting out?"

"What does a typical day look like for this role?"

"What do the first 60 days look like in this role? The first 6 months?" (chances are the answers will differ significantly! And this helps you determine what kind of onboarding support/guidance is offered to new hires)
